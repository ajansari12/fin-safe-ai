- Standardized hook naming across the codebase

### ✅ Phase 3: Cleanup (COMPLETE)
- Removed deprecated `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Removed legacy `useEnhancedAuth` export alias

## Status: ✅ MIGRATION COMPLETE

The build errors have been resolved through systematic updates of all import statements. The migration maintains zero breaking changes while providing enhanced authentication functionality.

## Key Benefits Achieved:
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Improved Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary re-exports
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Consistent patterns across all auth components
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Direct imports reduce bundle complexity

## Final Verification:
All remaining TypeScript errors related to missing AuthContext module have been resolved through comprehensive import updates across the entire codebase.
