# Comprehensive Testing Framework

This testing framework ensures platform reliability and compliance through multiple layers of testing.

## Test Structure

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/services/`, `src/__tests__/components/`
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Coverage**: All critical business logic, data validation, and UI components

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/services/`
- **Purpose**: Test API endpoints, database operations, and service integrations
- **Coverage**: Document management service, authentication flows, data persistence

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/e2e/`
- **Purpose**: Test complete user workflows and business processes
- **Coverage**: Document lifecycle, user permissions, approval workflows

### 4. Performance Tests
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/performance/`
- **Purpose**: Validate system performance under load
- **Coverage**: Concurrent operations, large file processing, response times

### 5. Security Tests
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/security/`
- **Purpose**: Assess security vulnerabilities and access controls
- **Coverage**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, audit trails

### 6. Data Quality Tests
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/data-quality/`
- **Purpose**: Ensure data integrity and validation
- **Coverage**: Form validation, bulk operations, migration testing

### 7. Accessibility Tests
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/accessibility/`
- **Purpose**: Verify WCAG compliance and usability
- **Coverage**: Keyboard navigation, screen readers, color contrast

### 8. Compliance Tests
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/compliance/`
- **Purpose**: Validate regulatory compliance (OSFI E-21)
- **Coverage**: Risk management, business continuity, audit requirements

### 9. Continuous Integration Tests
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/continuous/`
- **Purpose**: Automated pipeline validation
- **Coverage**: Code quality, build process, deployment readiness

### 10. Production Monitoring Tests
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/monitoring/`
- **Purpose**: Validate production health and performance
- **Coverage**: Application metrics, error tracking, user experience

## Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests only
npm run test:e2e

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Continuous Testing
```bash
# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# CI pipeline tests
npm run test:ci
```

## Test Configuration

### Coverage Thresholds
- Lines: 80%
- Branches: 75%
- Functions: 80%
- Statements: 80%

### Performance Benchmarks
- API Response Time: < 500ms average
- Page Load Time: < 3 seconds
- Memory Usage: < 100MB

### Security Standards
- Zero critical vulnerabilities
- Zero high-severity vulnerabilities
- Authentication required for all protected resources

### Compliance Requirements
- OSFI E-21 operational risk management
- Business continuity planning
- Audit trail maintenance
- Data governance and retention

## Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**: Group tests by functionality and test type
2. **Mock Strategy**: Mock external dependencies but test integration points
3. **Data Setup**: Use factories and fixtures for consistent test data
4. **Assertions**: Write clear, specific assertions with meaningful error messages
5. **Cleanup**: Ensure tests don't interfere with each other
6. **Documentation**: Document complex test scenarios and edge cases

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of test coverage and effectiveness
- Performance baseline updates
- Security test updates based on threat landscape
- Compliance test updates based on regulatory changes
- User feedback integration into testing scenarios
