  - Admin-only route protection for `/app/debug` and `/app/data`

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Admin Routes Implementation
- **Debug Page** (`src/pages/Debug.tsx`)
  - System health monitoring
  - User context debugging
  - Role and permission validation
  - Admin-only access with proper guards

- **Data Management Page** (`src/pages/DataManagement.tsx`)
  - Data export/import functionality
  - Storage statistics and monitoring
  - Retention policy management
  - Super admin controls with `RoleAwareComponent`

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Navigation Integration
- **Updated AuthenticatedLayout** 
  - Integrated role-aware navigation system
  - Dynamic breadcrumb generation
  - Permission-based menu filtering

## üéØ Permission System Architecture

### Role Definitions
```typescript
// Analyst: Read-only access to operational data
analyst: [
  'dashboard:view', 'risks:read', 'controls:read', 
  'incidents:read', 'governance:read', 'analytics:read'
]

// Manager: Full operational management
manager: [
  'dashboard:customize', 'risks:write', 'controls:write',
  'incidents:respond', 'governance:write', 'analytics:advanced'
]

// Reviewer: Approval and review workflows
reviewer: [
  'governance:approve', 'documents:approve', 'audit:review'
]

// Admin: Full system access including user management
admin: ['*'] // All permissions
```

### Route Protection Mapping
| Route | Required Permission | Admin Only | Description |
|-------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| `/app/dashboard` | `dashboard:view` | No | Main dashboard |
| `/app/risk-appetite` | `risks:read` | No | Risk management |
| `/app/controls-and-kri` | `controls:read` | No | Controls & KRIs |
| `/app/incident-log` | `incidents:read` | No | Incident management |
| `/app/governance` | `governance:read` | No | Governance framework |
| `/app/third-party-risk` | `third_party:read` | No | Vendor risk |
| `/app/business-continuity` | `continuity:read` | No | BCP management |
| `/app/scenario-testing` | `continuity:test` | No | Scenario testing |
| `/app/analytics` | `analytics:read` | No | Analytics hub |
| `/app/integrations` | `integrations:read` | No | System integrations |
| `/app/document-management` | `documents:read` | No | Document management |
| `/app/audit-and-compliance` | `audit:read` | No | Audit & compliance |
| `/app/reporting` | `reporting:read` | No | Reporting system |
| `/app/settings/roles` | `admin:roles` | ‚úÖ | Role management |
| `/app/settings/members` | `admin:users` | ‚úÖ | User management |
| `/app/debug` | `admin:debug` | ‚úÖ | System debugging |
| `/app/data` | `admin:data` | ‚úÖ | Data management |

## üîç QA Testing Framework

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Navigation Filtering
- **Analyst User**: Should see read-only sections (Dashboard, Risk Appetite, Controls, Incidents, Governance, Analytics)
- **Manager User**: Should see management sections + additional write permissions
- **Reviewer User**: Should see governance, documents, audit sections
- **Admin User**: Should see all sections including Settings ‚Üí Roles, Members, Debug, Data

#### 2. Route Access Control
- **Unauthorized Access**: Direct URL navigation to restricted routes should redirect to dashboard
- **Admin Routes**: `/app/debug` and `/app/data` should be accessible only to admins
- **Settings Tabs**: Admin-only tabs should be hidden from non-admin users

#### 3. Component-Level Permissions
- **RoleAwareComponent**: Used throughout the system for conditional rendering
- **Permission Hooks**: `useRoles()` and `usePermissions()` provide granular access control
- **Button/Form Guards**: Critical actions should be permission-gated

### Visual Indicators
- **Navigation**: Filtered menu items based on role
- **Settings Page**: Dynamic tab visibility (admin tabs hidden for non-admins)  
- **Debug Page**: Comprehensive role and permission debugging information
- **Data Management**: Super admin controls properly restricted

## üõ† Development Notes

### Key Components
1. **`src/config/permissions.ts`** - Central permission configuration
2. **`src/components/navigation/RoleAwareNavigation.tsx`** - Permission-aware navigation
3. **`src/components/ui/RoleAwareComponent.tsx`** - Conditional rendering component
4. **`src/hooks/useRoles.ts`** - Role-based access hooks
5. **`src/contexts/PermissionContext.tsx`** - Permission checking context

### Database Integration
- **User Roles**: Stored in `user_roles` table with proper RLS policies
- **Permission Mapping**: Client-side mapping from roles to permissions
- **Organization Scope**: All permissions are organization-scoped

### Security Considerations
- **Client-Side Guards**: UI filtering and route protection
- **Server-Side Validation**: RLS policies enforce data access at database level
- **Session Management**: Role context maintained throughout user session
- **Permission Inheritance**: Admins inherit all permissions automatically

## üìã QA Test Checklist

### Pre-Testing Setup
- [ ] Ensure test organization exists in database
- [ ] Create test users with different roles (analyst, manager, reviewer, admin)
- [ ] Verify user_roles table has proper role assignments
- [ ] Test authentication flow works correctly

### Navigation Testing
- [ ] Analyst sees only read-access menu items
- [ ] Manager sees additional write-access items  
- [ ] Reviewer sees governance and approval sections
- [ ] Admin sees all menu items including admin sections
- [ ] Menu items dynamically update based on role changes

### Route Protection Testing
- [ ] Direct URL access to restricted routes redirects appropriately
- [ ] Admin routes (`/app/debug`, `/app/data`) block non-admin access
- [ ] Settings page shows/hides admin tabs correctly
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation respects permission boundaries

### Component Permission Testing
- [ ] RoleAwareComponent correctly shows/hides content
- [ ] Admin-only buttons and forms are properly gated
- [ ] Permission hooks return correct values for each role
- [ ] Fallback content displays when access is denied

### Cross-Role Testing
- [ ] Role changes immediately update UI permissions
- [ ] Organization switching maintains proper role context
- [ ] Session persistence preserves role information
- [ ] Logout/login cycle resets permissions correctly

## üéâ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Complete role-based navigation filtering implemented**
‚úÖ **All routes properly protected with permission guards**  
‚úÖ **Admin-only sections accessible only to administrators**
‚úÖ **Debug and data management pages created and secured**
‚úÖ **Component-level permission system functional**
‚úÖ **QA testing framework and documentation provided**

The comprehensive role-based access control system is now fully implemented and ready for testing. Users will see dynamically filtered interfaces based on their assigned roles, with proper security boundaries enforced throughout the application.
